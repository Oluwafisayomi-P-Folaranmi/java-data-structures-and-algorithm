# Linear Recursion

A recursive problem contain two cases

1. ***Base case***
   - This is where your function must first test.
2. ***Recursive case***
   - Your function must test here after the base case. The ***scope*** here is that you must know the base case. Your recursive case must contain the infinity start (which is the farthest from the base case), and the recursive function which is defined in terms of the function.

We used both the ***base*** and the ***recursive*** cases here.
